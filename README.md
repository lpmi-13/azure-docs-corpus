# Azure Docs Corpus

Similar to the [AWS Docs Corpus](https://github.com/lpmi-13/aws-docs-corpus), this is going to be a place to gather all the Azure docs for alter text processing.

## Grabbing the docs locally

All the docs are in one repo, so just clone the repo

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs
```

## Processing the data

...no idea, I'll figure it out!
